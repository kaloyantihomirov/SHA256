# SHA-256 Text Hasher

This console application is designed to implement text hashing using the SHA-256 algorithm, which is part of the Secure Hash Algorithm 2 (SHA-2). The application provides the following functionalities:

1. **Read Message from File:**
   - Read a message from a specified file.

2. **Hash Message using SHA-256:**
   - Hash the read message using the SHA-256 algorithm.

3. **Save Hashed Message to File:**
   - Save the hashed message to a specified file.

4. **Verify Hashed Message:**
   - Determine whether a given hash matches the hash of the previously read message.
